                <p class="contexto1">Verified Graduate</p>
                <p class="contexto2">I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more
                    so,
                    in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</p>
                <p class="contexto3">I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a
                    transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up
                    for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
                    The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
                    the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup.</p>

                <p class="contexto6">“ I started as a total newbie with virtually no coding skills. I now work as
                    a mobile engineer for a big company. This was one of the best investments
                    I’ve made in myself. ”</p>

                    guidance from them and
                    learning from their experiences was easy.</p>
                <p class="contexto12">“The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really
                    refreshing. The program
                    gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable
                    junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from
                    an incredible community of smart and amazing people.”</p>

                    <p class="contexto14">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</p>
                    <p class="contexto15">“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some
                        structure from
                        professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
                        student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff
                        did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
                        project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial
                        could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development
                        experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
                        100% recommend! ”</p>
